# Jethro Severity Argument [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JethroLogger/Jethro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JethroLogger/Jethro) [![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/jethro.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/jethro) [![npm downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/jethro.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/jethro) [![Gratipay](http://img.shields.io/gratipay/Hunchmun.svg)](https://www.gratipay.com/Hunchmun/)

Severity is the primary argument passed to the Jethro logging function.

You can pass custom arguments to severity, but they will not be coloured, as below

Coloured Outputs
----------------

Here is the list of main outputs that are supported, and subsequently coloured

* Info          - Magenta
* Debug         - Blue
* Warning       - Yellow
* Error         - Red
* Transport     - Cyan

Please don't pass colour codes with a severity, as this will likely not work!
